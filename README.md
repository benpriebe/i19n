i19n
====

Provides i18n (internationalization) support as a RequireJS plugin. Like the i18n plugin - but one better ;)


The contents of that file should look like so:

```//my/nls/colors.js contents:
define({
    "root": {
        "red": "red",
        "blue": "blue",
        "green": "green"
    }
});
